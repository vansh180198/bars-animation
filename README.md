The code creates a simple animation of five bars inside a
container. Each bar's height changes randomly when the
"Start" button is clicked. The animation is controlled by three
buttons:
1. Start Button: When clicked, it starts changing the
heights of all five bars. Each bar's height is randomly
adjusted every second.
2. Stop Button: Stops the random height changes by
clearing the animation intervals.
3. Reset Button: Resets all bars to full height (100%) and
stops the animation.
The bars are displayed with smooth transitions, so when their
height changes, it happens gradually over 1 second. The
layout is managed using CSS Flexbox, and each bar has a
different color.
